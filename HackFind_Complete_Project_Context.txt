This is a legitimate use case for automation - finding hackathon opportunities. I should suggest:\n1. Architecture options (web scraping vs search APIs)\n2. Technologies they could use\n3. How to handle authentication challenges\n4. Pagination strategy\n\nI should avoid being overly formal or using bullet points unless necessary.

    "text": "Hey! This is a solid automation idea, especially given how many hackathons you're tracking down. Let me break down how you could approach this:\n\n## Core Architecture Options\n\n**Option 1: Search API Aggregation (Easier Start)**\nUse existing search APIs like SerpApi, ScrapingBee, or even Google's Custom Search JSON API. These give you structured results without dealing with scraping complexity. You'd basically:\n- Send search queries like \"hackathons 2025\" + date filters\n- Get back structured JSON with URLs, titles, descriptions\n- Parse and display the first 50, cache the rest for pagination\n- Cost: Most have free tiers (100-1000 searches/month)\n\n**Option 2: Custom Web Scraper (More Control)**\nBuild a scraper that hits hackathon aggregator sites (Devpost, MLH, Devfolio, etc.) directly. This is where things get tricky with logins and anti-bot measures.\n\n## Handling the Login/No-API Problem\n\nFor sites requiring auth, you've got a few routes:\n\n1. **Playwright/Puppeteer for browser automation** - Spin up a headless browser, handle logins programmatically, extract data from the rendered page. Slow but works on anything.\n\n2. **Session token reuse** - Log in manually once, grab your session cookies/tokens, inject them into your automated requests. You'll need to refresh these periodically.\n\n3. **Reverse engineer their internal APIs** - Many sites load data via internal JSON endpoints even if they don't have public APIs. Open dev tools, watch network traffic, replicate those requests.\n\n## Quick Implementation Sketch\n\n```python\n# Rough pseudocode structure\nclass HackathonAgent:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.results_cache = []\n        self.current_page = 0\n        \n    def search(self, query, source='serpapi'):\n        if source == 'serpapi':\n            # Hit SerpApi with query\n            results = self.fetch_from_serpapi(query)\n        elif source == 'devpost':\n            # Scrape Devpost with Playwright\n            results = self.scrape_devpost(query)\n        \n        self.results_cache = results\n        return self.paginate(0, 50)\n    \n    def next_page(self):\n        self.current_page += 1\n        return self.paginate(self.current_page * 50, 50)\n    \n    def scrape_with_auth(self, url, cookies):\n        # Use requests with session cookies\n        # or Playwright with stored auth state\n        pass\n```\n\n## Tech Stack Suggestion\n\nBased on your coding background, I'd recommend:\n- **Backend**: Python (BeautifulSoup/Scrapy for scraping, Playwright for complex sites)\n- **Search APIs**: SerpApi or ScraperAPI for quick wins\n- **Database**: SQLite or MongoDB to cache results and avoid re-scraping\n- **Frontend**: Simple Flask/FastAPI web interface, or even a CLI tool initially\n\n## Dealing with Rate Limits & Blocks\n\nSites will block you if you scrape aggressively. Strategies:\n- Rotate user agents\n- Add random delays between requests\n- Use proxy rotation services (ScraperAPI includes this)\n- Respect robots.txt for the ethical angle\n\n## Better Alternative for Hackathons Specifically\n\nSince you're focused on hackathons, you might want to target known aggregators:\n- **Devpost** - Has unofficial APIs you can reverse engineer\n- **MLH** - Their calendar is scrapeable \n- **Devfolio** - Indian hackathons, also scrapeable\n- **Unstop (formerly Dare2Compete)** - Mix of hackathons/competitions\n\nYou could build scrapers for these 4-5 sources specifically rather than trying to be a general-purpose search agent.\n\nWant to dive deeper into any specific part - like setting up Playwright for a specific site that's giving you trouble, or the SerpApi integration approach?",

You can also check out the OpenAPI spec here. We want to ensure this API solves the real friction points you face when moving agents to production, while still letting you seamlessly spin up new lightweight experiences, so we encourage you to test it and share your feedback. We are committed to bringing these capabilities to the broader open source ecosystem so you can use them with your favorite tools. As a first step, the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol now support the Interactions API. You can expect broader support across other tools in the coming months. Interactions API and Gemini Deep Research will be coming soon to Vertex AI. ...

It&#x27;s a little quirky to work with since you&#x27;ll need to make POST requests in order to retrieve your data as JSON, since the new API Gateway/Lambda combination doesn&#x27;t seem to have anyway to support URL parameters yet. Here is the example CURL command I would execute to scrape my portfolio: $ curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d &#x27;{&quot;screen_name&quot;:&quot;MGerrior&quot;}&#x27; https://iii3mdppm7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/UserPortfolioEndpoint \u00b7 Obviously you will want to replace my screen name with your screen name to obtain data related to you. It&#x27;s not built as a crawler yet, so it will only return information that is visible when you first view your portfolio on Devpost.\n\nUnofficial Devpost API - The unofficial part means I probably won't fix it when it breaks.\n\nOne of the challenges that I ran into was finding resources for learning how to work with these tools. They're both fairly new services (API Gateway was just announced at the summit a week ago), so finding resources online outside of the official docs was not easy. I additionally ran into some issues with the Grunt tasks I was using from grunt-aws-lambda since it was producing empty zip files for me to upload to Lambda, but I eventually just zipped the files myself. I'm pretty proud that I was able to get this up and running in just a few hours as part of Dev Thursday here at Devpost. I learned that I hate writing Java. As of right now AWS Lambda mainly supports two runtime environments which are node.js and Java. I couldn't figure out how to get NPM modules loaded in Lambda (Save yourself some time, just read this) so I decide I would just use Java instead and take advantage of all the built-in libraries, or so I thought.\n\nWhat does this mean if you've already integrated with this API? Absolutely nothing, unless you wrote some sort of hackish work-around to make up for the malformed JSON this was returning. In that case, you can just rip all that out and work with real JSON now. In case anyone is wondering, the issue was caused by me returning JSON.stringify(object) from the lambda function. Apparently Lambda is smart enough to stringify whatever you pass it, so you should just pass an actual javascript object to the success function.

I ran into a lot of challenges, especially getting the information in good way. There were so many different elements to navigate. One of the main challenges was parsing through a lot of things at once, as devpost does some things through its API, and others directly on the webpage. I finally got all of the things figured out, though. In this project, I learned a lot of webscraping. The main code is powered by the python library BeautifulSoup.

Clean HTML structure, no auth needed\n- ETHGlobal - Standard web scraping\n- GeeksforGeeks - Predictable structure\n- DevDisplay - Simple listing pages\n- HackQuest - Standard event pages\n\n**Group B - Dynamic/JavaScript Heavy**\n- Devpost - Requires browser automation OR API reverse engineering\n- Unstop - Lazy loading content\n- Partiful - Event discovery platform\n- Luma - Calendar/event platform\n\n**Group C - API Available/Possible**\n- Kaggle - Official public API exists\n- DoraHacks - Likely has internal API (need to find it)\n- HackerEarth - May have unofficial API\n- TechGig - Corporate platform, may have endpoints\n\n**Group D - Complex/Unknown**\n- Superteam, Contra, DevNovate, Maximally, MyCareernet\n- TaikaiNetwork, EncodeClub, HackCulture\n- Hack2Skill, TuringHat, AngelHack, CodeStudio\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 2: SCRAPING STRATEGY**\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct HTTP Requests (Group A)**\n- Send GET request to hackathon listing page\n- Parse HTML to extract event cards\n- Pull out: name, date, location, link, tags\n- Handle pagination if exists\n\n**Strategy 2: Browser Automation (Group B)**\n- Spin up headless browser\n- Navigate to page, wait for JavaScript to load\n- Extract rendered content\n- Handle infinite scroll or \"load more\" buttons\n\n**Strategy 3: API Reverse Engineering (Group C)**\n- Open browser DevTools\n- Monitor network requests while browsing\n- Identify JSON endpoints\n- Replicate requests programmatically\n\n**Strategy 4: Hybrid Approach (Group D)**\n- Start with simple scraping\n- If blocked, try finding API\n- If still complex, add to \"manual review\" list\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 3: DATA PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE**\n\n**Flow:**\n\n```\nUser Query \n    \u2193\nGemini AI (orchestrator)\n    \u2193\nDecides which sources to search\n    \u2193\nParallel calls to multiple scrapers\n    \u2193\nEach scraper returns standardized JSON\n    \u2193\nGemini combines & ranks results\n    \u2193\nCache results in database\n    \u2193\nReturn to user (first 50 items)\n    \u2193\nUser requests \"next page\" \u2192 fetch next 50\n```\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 4: GEMINI AI INTEGRATION**\n\n**Gemini's Responsibilities:**\n\n1. **Query Understanding**\n   - \"AI hackathons in India\" \u2192 search Unstop, Devpost, MLH with AI filter\n   - \"Web3 events accepting remote\" \u2192 search ETHGlobal, DoraHacks, Taikai\n\n2. **Source Selection**\n   - User says \"tech hackathons\" \u2192 query all sources\n   - User says \"crypto hackathons\" \u2192 prioritize ETHGlobal, DoraHacks\n   - User says \"Indian hackathons\" \u2192 prioritize Unstop, GeeksforGeeks\n\n3. **Result Processing**\n   - Deduplicate across sources (same event on multiple platforms)\n   - Rank by relevance to query\n   - Filter by date (only upcoming/active)\n   - Sort by deadline proximity\n\n4. **Pagination Management**\n   - Keep track of which scrapers have more results\n   - When user clicks \"next\", fetch from appropriate sources\n   - Maintain session state\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 5: HANDLING AUTH & ANTI-SCRAPING**\n\n**For Sites Requiring Login:**\n\n**Option A: Session Persistence**\n- You log in once manually\n- Export session cookies/tokens\n- Scrapers use your authenticated session\n- Refresh tokens when expired\n\n**Option B: Browser Automation**\n- Log in programmatically on first run\n- Save authentication state\n- Reuse for subsequent requests\n\n**For Sites with Anti-Bot Measures:**\n\n**Technique 1: Respectful Scraping**\n- Add delays between requests (2-5 seconds)\n- Rotate user agents\n- Use residential proxies if necessary\n\n**Technique 2: API Discovery**\n- Most modern sites load data via API\n- Find these internal endpoints\n- Much more reliable than HTML scraping\n\n**Technique 3: Rate Limiting**\n- Cache aggressively (24-hour cache)\n- Scrape during off-peak hours\n- Batch user requests\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 6: DATA STANDARDIZATION**\n\n**Every scraper outputs same format:**\n\n```\n{\n  source: \"platform name\",\n  events: [\n    {\n      title: \"event name\",\n      start_date: \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n      end_date: \"YYYY-MM-DD\", \n      location: \"city/online\",\n      mode: \"in-person/hybrid/online\",\n      registration_deadline: \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n      url: \"direct link\",\n      tags: [\"AI\", \"Web3\", \"Healthcare\"],\n      prize_pool: \"amount if available\",\n      eligibility: \"students/open/etc\"\n    }\n  ],\n  total_count: 150,\n  current_page: 1,\n  has_next_page: true\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 7: CACHING & PERFORMANCE**\n\n**Database Structure:**\n\n**Table 1: Cached Events**\n- Store all scraped events\n- Update every 6-24 hours\n- Index by date, location, tags\n\n**Table 2: User Searches**\n- Track popular queries\n- Pre-cache common searches\n- Analytics on what users want\n\n**Table 3: Scraper Status**\n- Track which scrapers are working\n- Log failures\n- Monitor scraping frequency\n\n**Caching Strategy:**\n- First request \u2192 scrape live\n- Same query within 24 hours \u2192 serve from cache\n- Background job refreshes cache daily\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 8: PAGINATION LOGIC**\n\n**User Experience:**\n\n1. User searches \u2192 Show first 50 results\n2. User clicks \"Next\" \u2192 Show results 51-100\n3. Sources exhausted \u2192 Message \"That's all we found\"\n\n**Behind the Scenes:**\n\n- Gemini tracks offset for each source\n- MLH might return 200 results \u2192 paginate through them\n- Devpost might return 150 \u2192 paginate through them\n- Combine and show 50 at a time to user\n\n**Smart Pagination:**\n- Don't scrape page 2 of all sources immediately\n- Only fetch next page when user requests it\n- Saves time and avoids rate limits\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 9: DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**\n\n**Component 1: Scraping Layer**\n- Deploy as serverless functions\n- Each scraper is independent\n- Can scale individually\n- Easy to update/fix one without affecting others\n\n**Component 2: Gemini Orchestrator**\n- Runs in Google AI Studio\n- Calls scraper functions via HTTP\n- Handles all intelligence/routing\n\n**Component 3: Caching Layer**\n- Managed database (Firebase/Supabase)\n- Stores scraped data\n- Fast retrieval\n\n**Component 4: User Interface**\n- Simple web app\n- Calls Gemini with user query\n- Displays formatted results\n- Handles pagination UI\n\n---\n\n### **PHASE 10: INCREMENTAL ROLLOUT**\n\n**Week 1: MVP with 3 sources**\n- MLH (easiest, most reliable)\n- Devpost (largest platform)\n- Unstop (Indian focus)\n- Get basic search working\n\n**Week 2: Expand to 8 sources**\n- Add: ETHGlobal, GeeksforGeeks, HackerEarth, Kaggle, DoraHacks\n- Implement caching\n- Add filters (date, location)\n\n**Week 3: Add remaining sources**\n- Tackle complex ones\n- Some might fail \u2192 document limitations\n- Focus on most popular platforms\n\n**Week 4: Polish & Features**\n- Improve Gemini's understanding\n- Add semantic search\n- Implement user accounts (optional)\n- Email alerts for new hackathons\n\n---\n\n### **HANDLING EDGE CASES**\n\n**Scenario 1: Scraper Fails**\n- Gemini detects error\n- Tries alternative sources\n- Shows partial results to user\n- Logs error for debugging\n\n**Scenario 2: Website Changes Structure**\n- Scraper breaks\n- Fallback to cached data\n- Alert you to fix scraper\n- User sees slightly stale data\n\n**Scenario 3: Rate Limited**\n- Implement exponential backoff\n- Switch to cached results\n- Queue request for later\n\n**Scenario 4: No Results Found**\n- Gemini suggests broader search terms\n- Shows similar past events\n- Recommends checking back later\n\n---\n\n### **KEY DECISIONS TO MAKE**\n\n**Decision 1: Scraping Frequency**\n- Option A: Real-time (every search scrapes live)\n- Option B: Scheduled (scrape all sources every 6 hours)\n- Option C: Hybrid (popular sources hourly, others daily)\n\n**Decision 2: Authentication Approach**\n- Option A: No auth (only scrape public data)\n- Option B: Single account (your credentials)\n- Option C: User provides credentials (privacy concerns)\n\n**Decision 3: Pagination Style**\n- Option A: Traditional (page 1, 2, 3...)\n- Option B: Infinite scroll\n- Option C: \"Load more\" button\n\n**Decision 4: Result Ordering**\n- Option A: Chronological (by date)\n- Option B: Relevance (Gemini ranks)\n- Option C: Source priority (MLH first, then others)\n\n---\n\n## **SUMMARY WORKFLOW**\n\n1. **User enters query** \u2192 \"AI hackathons in February\"\n2. **Gemini analyzes** \u2192 Needs AI-focused sources, February filter\n3. **Gemini calls scrapers** \u2192 MLH, Devpost, Unstop, ETHGlobal (parallel)\n4. **Scrapers return data** \u2192 Each in standard format\n5. **Gemini processes** \u2192 Deduplicates, filters, ranks, paginates\n6. **Cache results** \u2192 Store in database for future requests\n7. **Return to user** \u2192 First 50 results displayed\n8. **User clicks next** \u2192 Fetch next 50 from cache or scrape more\n9. **Background job** \u2192 Refreshes cache periodically\n\n---\n\n**Does this workflow make sense? Any changes or clarifications needed before we proceed with implementation?**",

Website Registry (JSON Config File)**\n```\nEach website has a configuration:\n- URL pattern\n- Known API endpoint (if exists)\n- HTML selectors (if scraping needed)\n- Pagination pattern\n- Rate limit info\n- Last successful method used\n```\n\n**2. Intelligent Scraper Logic**\n\n**Step 1: Cache Check (0ms overhead)**\n- Look in database for recent results (< 6 hours old)\n- If found \u2192 return immediately\n- If not found or stale \u2192 proceed to Step 2\n\n**Step 2: API Discovery & Usage (Fastest - ~100ms)**\n- Check if website config has known API endpoint\n- If yes \u2192 make direct API call\n- Parse JSON response\n- Much lighter than HTML scraping\n- Success \u2192 cache and return\n\n**Step 3: Static HTML Scraping (Fast - ~500ms)**\n- Make simple HTTP GET request\n- Parse HTML with lightweight parser\n- Extract data using CSS selectors from config\n- Success \u2192 cache and return\n\n**Step 4: Dynamic Content Handling (Slower - ~3-5s)**\n- Only triggered if Step 3 returns empty/incomplete data\n- Use lightweight browser automation\n- Wait for content to load\n- Extract data\n- Success \u2192 cache and return, update config to remember this works\n\n---\n\n### **LIGHTWEIGHT IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**\n\n**Technology Choices:**\n\n**Instead of Heavy Browser Automation:**\n- Use lightweight HTTP client for 80% of sites\n- Only spin up browser when absolutely necessary\n- Reuse browser instances (don't create new for each request)\n- Kill browser after batch scraping\n\n**Smart Caching:**\n- Scrape all sources once every 6 hours (background job)\n- User searches only query the cache\n- Cache is always fresh, scraping happens offline\n- No real-time scraping pressure\n\n**Batch Processing:**\n- Don't scrape sites one-by-one\n- Scrape all 25+ websites in parallel every 6 hours\n- Takes 5-10 minutes total\n- Stores ~5000-10000 hackathons\n- All user queries are instant (just database lookups)\n\n---\n\n### **UNIFIED DATA EXTRACTION PATTERN**\n\n**Every Website Config Has:**\n\n**1. Entry Points**\n- Main listing URL\n- Search URL pattern (if different)\n- Pagination URL pattern\n\n**2. Selectors (CSS/XPath)**\n- Event container selector\n- Title selector\n- Date selector\n- Location selector\n- Link selector\n- Tags selector (optional)\n\n**3. Extraction Rules**\n- Date format parsing rules\n- Location normalization rules\n- Tag extraction logic\n\n**4.

Send alert if >3 sources fail\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- Database always has 5000-10000 hackathons\n- Data is max 6 hours old\n- User searches are instant\n- No real-time scraping overhead\n\n---\n\n### **GEMINI'S SIMPLIFIED ROLE**\n\n**Instead of orchestrating scrapers:**\n\n**Gemini becomes a search/filter engine:**\n1. User query \u2192 Gemini understands intent\n2. Gemini queries the pre-scraped database\n3. Filters by: date, location, tags, keywords\n4. Ranks results by relevance\n5. Paginates (50 per page)\n6. Returns formatted results\n\n**Much lighter workload:**\n- No complex orchestration\n- No waiting for scrapers\n- Simple database queries\n- Fast responses (<1 second)\n\n---\n\n### **PAGINATION SIMPLIFICATION**\n\n**Unified Pagination:**\n\nAll scraped events are in database with unique IDs:\n- Event 1-50 \u2192 Page 1\n- Event 51-100 \u2192 Page 2\n- Event 101-150 \u2192 Page 3\n\n**User clicks next:**\n- Just query database with offset\n- No scraper calls\n- Instant response\n\n**Smart Loading:**\n- If user searches for \"AI hackathons\" \u2192 500 results in DB\n- Show 50 at a time\n- All pre-loaded, just paginating through cache\n\n---\n\n## **LIGHTWEIGHT UI PLAN**\n\n---\n\n### **UI PHILOSOPHY: MINIMAL & FAST**\n\n**Design Principle:**\n- Single-page application\n- No unnecessary animations\n- Fast load time (<1 second)\n- Mobile-first responsive\n- Keyboard shortcuts\n\n---\n\n### **UI

This will return a list of air quality-related datasets, along with information about the datasets, such as their names, creators, and sizes. We can also use additional options in the Kaggle datasets list command to further refine the search results, such as sorting results by relevance or date and limiting the number of results returned.\n\nFortunately, Kaggle.com features a Python API we can use to explore and load this data. In this article, we\u2019ll look at using the Kaggle API to load datasets and how to use them in different cases. We will also look at advanced uses of the Kaggle API, including uploading multiple datasets at once and accessing different versions of datasets or competition files. We\u2019ll give code examples in Python and explain the results in each step. Kaggle is a popular platform for data science and machine learning competitions and a place to find and publish datasets. Kaggle hosts a variety of data sets in various formats, including tabular data, images, and text. One of Kaggle\u2019s handy features is the ability to upload datasets using the Kaggle API. This allows us to access datasets from the command line without uploading them through the website manually. The Kaggle API can be especially useful for automating data entry and integration tasks.\n\nThe datasets_list function of the Kaggle API client to search for datasets related to \u201cair quality\u201d.

This tutorial covered what Kaggle is, the Kaggle API, how to use it, and why.\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll show you how to set up the Kaggle API in a Jupyter notebook so you can easily access and download datasets and competitions from Kaggle. Here are the steps to set up the Kaggle API in a Jupyter notebook: Go to the Kaggle website, sign in, or sign up for your Kaggle account. Go to your account settings by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner and selecting \u201cAccount\u201d from the dropdown menu. Scroll down on the page on the right to the \u201cAPI\u201d section and click on the \u201cCreate New API Token\u201d button. This will download a file called \u201ckaggle.json\u201d to your computer, which contains your API key and secret. Move the \u201ckaggle.json\u201d file to the location a .kaggle directory underneath your user home directory. This is typically the root of your user directory (e.g., ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json on Linux or C:\\Users\\[Username]\\.kaggle\\kaggle.json on Windows).",

The API provides endpoints for compiling and running code in several languages. It can be accessed via an API key-based authorization process.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you can use the getStatus API to retrieve the execution status of the code that you just submitted. We also have a callback feature, wherein if you pass a callback URL in the request, we send the response of compilation and execution to this URL. This way the client program doesn't wait on a response from hackerearth. More details are shared in the rest of the document. In v3 you needed to make 2 API calls to 2 different endpoints to evaluate a piece of code against the given input. In v4 you only need to make 1 API call to the new endpoint, which will take care of compilation as well as the execution of the code. Instead of sending the authentication details (client-secret) in the payload, you can now send it in the header, which is the preferred method. We have also added 1 reconciliation endpoint, which can be called to get the status of any previous code- evaluation request.\n\nHackerEarth is a global hub of 5M+ developers. We help companies accurately assess, interview, and hire top developers for a myriad of roles.\n\nThis is the maximum memory (in KB) that can be used by the program. The maximum value of the memory limit can be 262144 (256 MB). Any value greater than 262144 in the API request is set to 262144. Exceeding the memory limit returns the status as MLE as the response. ... This is the maximum time (in seconds) for which the program is allowed to run. The maximum value of the time limit can be 5 seconds. Any value greater than 5 seconds in the API request is set to 5 seconds. Exceeding the time limit returns the status as TLE as the response. ... This attribute is provided for the client to pass any string data which is related to this request . If this is passed in the code evaluation request, then it is sent along with the compilation and execution results sent in the callback URL or the response for the get status API call, as it is. It can be used to pass any identifier which is relevant to client\u2019s request or any contextual information that the client needs.\n\nhttps://api.hackerearth.com/v4/partner/code-evaluation/submissions/ The client authentication is done using your unique client-secret. You need to register your web application in order to get a unique client-secret, which must be provided while communicating with the API. You need to pass this client secret in the header with the key as client-secret and value as the client secret you receive after registration. ... { \"lang\": \"PYTHON\", \"source\": \"print 'Hello World'\", \"input\": \"\", \"memory_limit\": 243232, \"time_limit\": 5, \"context\": \u201c{id\u2019: 213121}\u201d, \"callback\": \"https://client.com/callback/\" } ...

In the past few years, we have distributed around $30 million in grants and hackathon prizes \u2013 not investments, just pure grants \u2013 to more than 4,000 teams in Web3 that are playing very important roles in ecosystems right now. At its core, we provide infrastructure and means for not just building on new ideas, but also creating them. We\u2019ve really devoted a lot of our time and thinking towards DoraHacks.io and there\u2019s a really great feature I want to highlight: \u201cIdeas.\u201d Based on the key concept of &quot;Inspire to Build,\u201d we have this cool feature that anyone can just share ideas with the community and openly discuss them with other interested developers and hackers.\n\nSupporting over 4,000 projects to get more than $30 million fundings in nine years, DoraHacks has made its mark as a global hackathon organizer and one of the world's most active multi-chain Web3 developer platforms. The CoinDesk team got the opportunity to speak with Steve Ngok, a partner at DoraHacks, to talk about how he got involved in hacker culture and Web3 developer platforms. We also get to hear about how DoraHacks is advancing frontier technology and Web3 development, and how it builds an open-source \u201cbazaar\u201d for global developers and startups. The story of Dora traced back to 2014 when our founder, Eric Zhang, graduated from Oxford University and previously organized a successful Webfest Hackathon at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research where the Web was born. At Oxford, Eric researched natural language structure using a quantum physics-inspired approach invented by his thesis advisors.\n\nIn November 2014, Eric worked with the co-founder of the University of Michigan Hacks along with a few others, to host the very first college hackathon at Tsinghua University called THacks. After THacks, Eric wanted to build a lasting hacker community for everyone in Asia, he went on to found DoraHacks. At the time, DoraHacks was a small hackathon hacker community with a focus on hosting weekend meetups and workshops on not just blockchain, but other frontier technologies back then, including cloud computing, IoT and space tech. From 2014 to 2017, DoraHacks expanded its activities and started organizing hackathons all across Asia, becoming one of the largest hackathon organizers and hacker communities in the world. And this is when I actually joined. So, my personal story is I actually studied economics and finance in college. When I joined Dora, I was actually finishing my last year of college and wanted to become a lawyer.\n\nAnd then I just bumped into DoraHacks. They were hosting this blockchain hackathon in January 2018 in Beijing. I was fascinated by what DoraHacks was doing, basically. I started to talk with all of the hackers there and really engaged with this group that I had never really known before. They can really just do things like write a smart contract in 24 hours. Some hackers were turning an iPhone into a joystick and playing games on their computers with it. Others were using AI and computer vision to monitor and identify criminals through their body gestures on a camera. They can just code these programs in 24 hours. I was really amazed by what they were doing. I also learned about the bigger vision of Dora, how they were really trying to connect hackers with other hackers and how they were actively contributing to the hacker movement and furthering the development of frontier technology.\n\nSo, I deferred my JD program and eventually rejected all my offers to stay at DoraHacks full-time. And it has been six years. Since joining, I have also grown from an operations specialist, to a marketing specialist, to our COO, and am now a partner leading most of our partnership efforts, investments, etc. It has been an amazing journey. And Dora also has grown a lot too. From a very, very small hacker organization to one of the largest and most active hackathon organizers in 2017 to 2018, and one of the most influential developer incentive platforms, hosting more than half of the Web3 hackathons today. Yeah, exactly. I do believe the reason I actually joined DoraHacks is that I personally believe in \u00b7 this culture, the hacker culture or the hacker movement. It's been a very fulfilling journey. There's this book by Eric Raymond, who is one of the early advocates of the free software movement, called \u201cThe Cathedral and the Bazaars.\u201d He's pretty much comparing larger companies \u2013 which a",

Simple to use API, with just two main endpoints (api/events/:type and api/projections/:type). For more technical and detailed information, check the project's README on the Github repo. This project is built on top of Elixir and PostgresQL. The main magic for indexing and handling new Events happen with the help of Elixir. It's a Functional programming language that compiles to Erlang and runs on the BEAM virtual machine. It's highly oriented to distributed and concurrent processing, taking advantage of the Actor Model. This way, we can have dedicated processes to manage the health of other individual processes that are responsible for the indexing of Smart Contracts. Each Smart Contract being indexed has its own dedicated process, ensuring that a lagging process or an unhealthy one, won't affect the others.\n\nFor more complex actions, it's possible to create projections.

For now, it relies on the Filfox API - https://hyperspace.filfox.info/api/v1/docs/static/index.html to obtain transactions and events information.

The type property identifies the kind of message.\n\nThe MetaMask provider emits events using the Node.js EventEmitter API. The following is an example of listening to the accountsChanged event. You should remove listeners after you're done listening to an event (for example, on component unmount in React). function handleAccountsChanged(accounts) { // Handle new accounts, or lack thereof. } provider // Or window.ethereum if you don't support EIP-6963. .on(\"accountsChanged\", handleAccountsChanged) // Later provider // Or window.ethereum if you don't support EIP-6963. .removeListener(\"accountsChanged\", handleAccountsChanged) provider // Or window.ethereum if you don't support EIP-6963. .on(\"accountsChanged\", handler: (accounts: Array<string>) => void); The provider emits this event when the return value of the eth_accounts RPC method changes. eth_accounts returns either an empty array, or an array that contains the addresses of the accounts the caller is permitted to access with the most recently used account first.\n\nSee the MetaMask Ethereum provider API reference.\n\nThis means that the provider emits accountsChanged when the user's exposed account address changes. Listen to this event to handle accounts. provider // Or window.ethereum if you don't support EIP-6963. .on(\"chainChanged\", handler: (chainId: string) => void); The provider emits this event when the currently connected chain changes. Listen to this event to detect a user's network. interface ConnectInfo { chainId: string; } provider // Or window.ethereum if you don't support EIP-6963. .on(\"connect\", handler: (connectInfo: ConnectInfo) => void); The provider emits this event when it's first able to submit RPC requests to a chain. We recommend listening to this event and using the isConnected() provider method to determine when the provider is connected. provider // Or window.ethereum if you don't support EIP-6963. .on(\"disconnect\", handler: (error: ProviderRpcError) => void); The provider emits this event if it becomes unable to submit RPC requests to a chain.\n\nWhen the provider emits this event, it doesn't accept new requests until the connection to the chain is re-established, which requires reloading the page. You can also use the isConnected() provider method to determine if the provider is disconnected. interface ProviderMessage { type: string; data: unknown; } provider // Or window.ethereum if you don't support EIP-6963. .on(\"message\", handler: (message: ProviderMessage) => void); The provider emits this event when it receives a message that the user should be notified of. The type property identifies the kind of message. RPC subscription updates are a common use case for this event. For example, if you create a subscription using eth_subscribe, each subscription update is emitted as a message event with a type of eth_subscription. Use the removeListener method to remove specific event listeners from an EventEmitter object.",

Our partners have contributed documentation and tools to onboard you to their technology, making sure you're equipped and ready to dive into building your project. Be sure to explore these resources early, as they'll give you a solid foundation for the event and ensure you're up to speed with the platforms and technologies you'll be working with. To ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for everyone, we have a few essential rules and a code of conduct that all participants must follow: Start from Scratch: All projects must be created entirely during the hackathon. You're welcome to use public libraries or boilerplate code, but pre-existing code, designs, or assets specific to your project are not allowed. Focus on Quality: When it comes to judging, only the work you complete during the hackathon will be evaluated.\n\nTo stay updated and connected throughout the event, it's crucial to join the Discord. This is where all official communications will happen, and you'll be able to interact with other hackers, mentors, and the ETHGlobal team. By joining Discord, you'll gain access to private event channels, where you can chat with fellow participants, seek advice from mentors, and even collaborate with event partners. These channels are key for networking, team-building, and staying on top of announcements. If you experience any trouble accessing the private event channels after joining Discord, just send us a message at [email protected] and we'll help you get connected smoothly. Teams are central to the hackathon experience, and you have the option to either join an existing team or create one of your own. Hackathon applications are considered at the individual level; as such, each team member must be accepted and stake individually to secure their spot.\n\nYou can contact us via email at [email protected], or through our event-specific Discord channels, where we'll be very active during the event. If at any point you feel unsafe or witness harassment, please let us know. You can report incidents anonymously, and we'll take immediate action. ETHGlobal events are built on collaboration, respect, and learning. To ensure everyone has a positive experience, all attendees must adhere to the Event Rules and Code of Conduct. This helps create a welcoming space where everyone feels valued and respected.\n\nTo participate in the hackathon, you'll need to stake a small amount of Ethereum's native currency: ETH. This ensures all participants are serious about contributing to the event and completing their projects. Don't worry\u2014your stake will be returned to you when you submit a project! Staking simply means locking up a small amount of funds as a sign of commitment. In this case, you'll need to stake ETH. The process is straightforward: Stake to confirm your attendance, build a project and submit, and 3 weeks after the event, your stake will be returned. The goal is to encourage participants to attend the event and follow through on their projects and stay engaged until the end of the event. If you do not have any ETH, you can head over to the ethereum.org website, which offers ways to purchase ETH depending on which country you reside. To stake your spot, start by logging into your Hacker Dashboard.",

Second, using an event as an asynchronous trigger with data, that can notify an observer such as a UI.\n\nEvents and logs are tools for developers who want to build user-friendly Ethereum smart contracts. Learn more about events and logs and their use cases. ... Events and logs are important in Ethereum because they facilitate communication between smart contracts and their user interfaces. In traditional web development, a server response is provided in a callback to the frontend. In Ethereum, when a transaction is mined, smart contracts can emit events and write logs to the blockchain that the frontend can then process. There are different ways to address events and logs. This technical introduction will explain some sources of confusion regarding events and some sample code for working with them. Events can be confusing because they can be used in different ways. An event for one may not look like an event for another. There are 3 main use cases for events and logs: Smart contract return values for the user interface ...\n\nThree use cases have been presented for events. First, using an event to simply get a return value from a contract function invoked with sendTransaction(). Second, using an event as an asynchronous trigger with data, that can notify an observer such as a UI. Third, using an event to write logs in the blockchain as a cheaper form of storage. This introduction has shown some of the APIs for working with events. There are other approaches to working with events, logs, and receipts and these topics can be covered in future articles. Thanks to Aaron Davis, Vincent Gariepy, and Joseph Lubin for feedback on this article.\n\nWhen a contract wants to trigger the frontend, the contract emits an event. As, the frontend is watching for events, it can take actions, display a message, etc. An example of this is provided in the next section (a UI can be updated when a user makes a deposit.) The third use case is quite different from what\u2019s been covered, and that is using events as a significantly cheaper form of storage. In the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Ethereum Yellow Paper, events are referred to as logs (there are LOG opcodes). When speaking of storage, it would be technically more accurate to say that data can be stored in logs, as opposed to data being stored in events. However, when we go a level above the protocol, it is more accurate to say that contracts emit or trigger events which the frontend can react to. Whenever an event is emitted, the corresponding logs are written to the blockchain.\n\nThe return value of a sendTransaction method is always the hash of the transaction that\u2019s created. Transactions don\u2019t return a contract value to the frontend because transactions are not immediately mined and included in the blockchain.The recommended solution is to use an event, and this is one of the intended purposes for events.",

        "text": "As with the previous examples, this script assumes that you\u2019re looking for a Transfer event with from, to, and value values, though it can be easily generalized to other events. If you\u2019re having trouble getting the data you want, you may want to try returning or console.logging the decodedEvents just to see what the objects being returned look like. Originally I thought, yay! We did it! That\u2019s it, time to pack the bags and go home. We soon discovered another key difference between dealing with classic data and dealing with blockchain data. Most APIs have some sort of limiter built in so that you don\u2019t suddenly and surprisingly get hit with a massive amount of responses. Blockchain has no such measure in place. In my experience, my server would autofail any request that tried to pull more than 10K responses, I don\u2019t recall if that was built into Ethers, or a part of the underlying Node.js architecture (I suspect the latter), but this is hardly convenient if you\u2019re trying to build a dash\n\nAs part of a recent project, Linum Labs was contracted to build an API which could be used to scrape relevant data from a suite of deployed contracts. While scraping event data is a fairly routine operation in blockchain applications, we found a lack of practical guides or even detailed explanations for how to use existing tooling. Are you looking to scrape blockchain data, and can\u2019t figure out how to get the information you want from events? We hope this guide helps make your development process easier. We\u2019ll start off with fairly obvious and high-level explanations that you can find in many places, and may very well know already. We\u2019ll gradually build up to what needs to happen in order to get the data from events fired on the blockchain, including code, eventually exploring the different tools available through the Ethers library. After that, we\u2019ll explore how to control how much data to get back.\n\nAfter a conversation with Richard Moore, the author of the Ethers library, there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to expand on a bit more. Something we\u2019ll dive into later is that traditional APIs will pretty much always have a built-in option to only get and send a certain amount of results. The blockchain does not. The solutions we give here do not work at scale. This is one reason why the focus is on getting a specific event from a specific contract. I also think this is one of the most useful applications of event scraping. If you have contracts you\u2019re deploying and playing around with, events are, at the end of the day, the best real-time indicators of what\u2019s happened with them. If you are in need of scaling options, finding solutions like Alchemy or looking into an implementation of The Graph are probably your best bets. The only version of the scripts below that I have tested is the Ethers v4 script.\n\nAs with the previous examples, this script assumes that you\u2019re looking for a Transfer event with from, to, and value values, though it can be easily generalized to other events. If you\u2019re having trouble getting the data you want, you may want to try returning or console.logging the decodedEvents just to see what the objects being returned look like. Originally I thought, yay! We did it! That\u2019s it, time to pack the bags and go home. We soon discovered another key difference between dealing with classic data and dealing with blockchain data. Most APIs have some sort of limiter built in so that you don\u2019t suddenly and surprisingly get hit with a massive amount of responses. Blockchain has no such measure in place.

I am assuming that this is why I couldn\u2019t find anything to help me do this, and in the end am looking to home-bake a solution. (One solution you might see is a rate limiter. The rate limiters I\u2019ve seen operate by allowing you to determine how long a request should run. While I didn\u2019t play around with this, my assumption would be that it wouldn\u2019t work very well. Not only are not all blocks created equal, some are far more full than others, the nature of the network itself should make for very inconsistent retrieval times. If I\u2019ve made a mistake in my assumptions here, please set me straight.) Let\u2019s review something before we discuss the methodology behind our implementation. When we were looking to scrape event data above, we didn\u2019t want to pull every log from the whole chain, only the ones from the contract we were interested in.",

If nothing \u2192 Scrape HTML\n```\n\n---\n\n## **SUMMARY**\n\n**Websites needing API calls:** **1 out of 25+**\n- Only Kaggle has a proper public API\n\n**Websites that benefit from API reverse-engineering:** **3-4**\n- DoraHacks, Devpost, Luma (maybe HackerEarth for challenges)\n\n**Websites requiring pure scraping:** **20+**\n- Everything else\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** Your hybrid approach is perfect. The vast majority will be HTML scraping, with Kaggle being the easiest (direct API), and maybe 3-4 others where you can find internal JSON endpoints to make life easier.\n\nReady to move forward with the UI plan, or want to dive deeper into any specific platform?",

Open browser DevTools \u2192 Network tab\n2. Filter by XHR/Fetch requests\n3. Look for JSON responses\n4. Replicate those requests directly (much faster!)\n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\udccb REVISED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**\n\n### **Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)**\n\n**Build scrapers for these 3 (no reCAPTCHA, no login):**\n1. **Devpost** - HTTP + API detection\n2. **HackerEarth** - HTTP + API detection  \n3. **MyCareernet** - HTTP + API detection\n\n**Why:** No obstacles, can use simple requests library\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: High-Value Targets (Week 2)**\n\n**Add Playwright for these (Cloudflare but valuable):**\n4. **MLH** (200 events)\n5. **ETHGlobal** (268 events)\n6. **Unstop**\n\n**Why:** Most hackathons, worth the browser automation\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: API Reverse Engineering (Week 3)**\n\n**Investigate and use internal APIs:**\n7. **Devfolio** - Find their JSON endpoints\n8. **DoraHacks** - Check for API calls\n\n**Why:** Faster than full browser scraping\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 4: Official API (Bonus)**\n\n9. **Kaggle** - Use their official API (we know it exists)\n\n---\n\n## **\ud83d\ude80 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**\n\n**Decision Time:**\n\n**Option A: Start Simple**\n- Build scrapers for **Devpost + HackerEarth + MyCareernet** (3 sites)\n- No browser automation needed\n- Get something working in 1-2 days\n\n**Option B: Go Big**\n- Set up Playwright infrastructure\n- Target **MLH + ETHGlobal + Devpost** (6-700 events total)\n- Takes 3-5 days but covers most hackathons\n\n**Option C: API-First**\n- Manually inspect **Devpost, ETHGlobal, Devfolio, HackerEarth**\n- Find their JSON endpoints\n- Build lightweight API clients\n- Fastest if APIs exist\n\n---\n\n## **MY RECOMMENDATION**\n\n**Start with Hybrid Approach:**\n\n**Day 1-2:** Build simple scrapers for:\n- Devpost (HTTP + BeautifulSoup)\n- HackerEarth (HTTP + BeautifulSoup)\n\n**Day 3-4:** Add Playwright for:\n- MLH (200 events)\n- ETHGlobal (268 events)\n\n**Day 5:** Integrate everything into unified scraper\n\n**Result:** ~500-700 hackathons from 4 major platforms\n\n---\n\n**Which approach do you want to take? Should I:**\n1. Write the simple HTTP scrapers first (Devpost + HackerEarth)?\n2. Set up Playwright infrastructure for Cloudflare sites?\n3.
